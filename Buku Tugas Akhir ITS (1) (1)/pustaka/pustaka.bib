ABSTRACT = {A service robot performs various professional services and domestic/personal services useful for organizations and humans in many application domains. Currently, the service robot industry is growing rapidly along with the technological advances of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In light of the great interest and potential of service robots, this study conducts a systematic review of the past and current research in service robots. This study examines the development activities for service robots across applications and industries and categorizes the service robots into four types. The categorization provides us with insights into the unique research activities and practices in each category of service robots. Then, this study analyzes the technological foundation that applies to all four categories of service robots. Finally, this study discusses opportunities and challenges that are understudied but potentially important for the future research of service robots.},

abstract = {Human–robot interaction (HRI) is an extensive and diverse research topic that has been gaining importance in last years. Different fields of study have used HRI approaches for solving complicated problems, where humans and robots interact in some way to obtain advantages from their collaboration. Many industrial areas benefit by applying HRI strategies in their applications, and agriculture is one of the most challenging of them. Currently, field crops can reach highly autonomous levels whereas speciality crops do not. In particular, crops such as fruits and vegetables are still harvested manually, and also some tasks such as pruning and thinning have long been considered to be too complex to automate completely. In addition, several countries face the problem of farm labour shortages. As a consequence, the production process is affected. In this context, we survey HRI approaches and ap-plications focused on improving the working conditions, agility, efficiency, safety, productivity and profitability of agricultural processes, in cases where manual labour cannot be replaced by but can be complemented with robots.}
